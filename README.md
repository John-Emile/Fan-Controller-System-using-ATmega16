# Fan-Controller-System-using-ATmega16
Temperature-controlled fan using ATmega16 microcontroller in which the fan is automatically turned ON or OFF according to the temperature.
The LM35 temperature sensor will give continuous analog output
corresponding to the temperature sensed by it. This analog signal is given to the ADC,
which converts the analog values to digital values.
